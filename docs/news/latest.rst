New in 1.2.0
------------

 * Added support for Hadoop 2.7.2.
 * Dropped support for Python 2.6. The main reasons are:
   the default in all major distributions is Python 2.7 and
   it will be easier for us to concentrate on new features and possibly on providing support for Python 3.
 * Bug fixes.
