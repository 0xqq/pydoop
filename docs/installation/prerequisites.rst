Prerequisites
=============

In order to build and install Pydoop, you need the following software:

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ version 2.5 or 2.6
* `Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org>`_ version 0.20.1 or later
* `Boost <http://www.boost.org>`_ version 1.35 or later

The first two are also runtime requirements for all cluster nodes.
