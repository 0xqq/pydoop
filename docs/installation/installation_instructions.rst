Installation Instructions
=========================

#. Set the ``JAVA_HOME`` and ``HADOOP_HOME`` environment variables to
   the correct locations for your system. setup.py defaults
   respectively to ``/opt/sun-jdk`` and ``/opt/hadoop``.

#. Run ``python setup.py install`` in the Pydoop distribution root.

If the above does not work, please read the :doc:`troubleshooting`
section.
