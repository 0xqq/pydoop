Patches for Hadoop C++ source code
==================================

NOTE: this doc is intended for developers, users can safely skip it.

Starting from release 0.7, Pydoop includes the pipes/utils C++ source
code for all supported Hadoop versions: this allows to sidestep the
increasingly cumbersome automated search for C++ files, whose location
varies greatly with the Hadoop version tag.

A simple tool for importing the C++ code we need has been placed in scripts/:

  $ scripts/import_src /opt/hadoop-1.0.3

We store the unpatched source code under src/hadoop-<VERSION_TAG>
(this makes it easier to spot changes when a new version is released)
and patch it on-the-fly while building Pydoop.  Patches can also be
applied manually by doing something like:

  for v in 0.20.2 0.20.2-cdh3u4 1.0.3 2.0.0-cdh4.0.1; do
    patch -d src/hadoop-${v} -p1 < patches/hadoop-${v}.patch;
  done
