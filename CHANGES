== Pydoop 0.3.7_rc1 ==

* Added support for Hadoop 0.21.0. Thanks to Cosmin Cătănoaie for contributing part of the required code.

== Pydoop 0.3.6 ==

* Pydoop is now released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

* Docs: installation section revised; installation-free example moved to top level; added a section dedicated to a comparison to Dumbo. Thanks to Allen Wittenauer for his comments and suggestions.

* hdfs_file objects are now iterators over the lines in the file, just like standard Python file objects.

* hdfs_file.tell: fixed a bug that limited seek values to 32bit integers.

* hdfs_file.read has been rewritten to work around a limitation of the underlying libhdfs read function that makes it read less than the requested number of bytes in proximity of block boundaries.

* split_hdfs_path has been rewritten to do its job without using urlparse: we decided not to rely on it anymore since it changed behavior between two minor releases of Python. Its argument is now required to be an hdfs path, as the function's name suggests. This means that "hdfs://localhost:9000" is no longer a valid argument, while "hdfs://localhost:9000/" is OK.

== Pydoop 0.3.6_rc2 ==

* added more usage examples.

* hdfs.hdfs_file: added flush.

* hdfs.hdfs: added the ability to connect as a specific user; added chown, chmod and utime.

* setup.py: changed to generate additional C++ source files only when build_ext is (indirectly or directly) called.

* utils.split_hdfs_path: added support for relative paths.

* All documentation is now generated with Sphinx.

== Pydoop 0.3.5 ==

* Changed some code that could possibly lead to memory leaks in some cases.


== Pydoop 0.3.4 ==

* added a patch for Ubuntu
* added API docs


== Pydoop 0.3.3 ==

* hdfs: get_path_info and list_directory have been fixed to correctly raise an IOError for nonexistent paths.


== Pydoop 0.3.2 ==

* hdfs: get_path_info has been fixed and now works correctly on directory paths.
* hdfs_file.readline: fixed a bug that led to wrong line reads in proximity of HDFS block boundaries.
* hdfs_file.seek: changed to reset readline-related parameters.
